# Completely resturcted file system:

- The main file to edit **Lee, Kristin** is Manuscripts/index.qmd
- Notebooks folder contains all the computations.
- Seperating them this way means that all the notebooks have embed outpt and the full manuscript alwasy renders quickly!
- To run the notebooks you may get the error module gsc not found, this is because if you open it as a vs-code folder from this main directroy it can't find the .py function files, you need to cd into the Notebooks folder then it will work.

something weird has happened with Notebooks and notebooks I think to do with git tracking of cases in windows and mac.
