        "  We develop a virtual clinical trial platform to face the real-world problem of numerous (hundred, perhaps thousands) of actual early phase clinical trials that have failed for glioma/glioblastoma.  We leverage an integrative mathematical modeling framework to translate the impact of those preclinical findings in virtual clinical trials. Even with the most promising preclinical data, designing clinical trials is fraught with challenges, including controlling for the many parameters used to inform patient selection criteria. Our virtual trial platform allows us to consider the variability from some of these criteria that can be used for future trial of such therapies. By comparing the simulation of the twin untreated and treated, we can estimate a predicted treatment benefit and measure it in units of time (days). This estimation allows us to anticipate if this novel therapy we hope to deploy in future clinical trials is likely effective. Given there is such huge variability across patients (a major factor contributing to the failure of treatments for glioblastoma), we can also repeat this process over several similar virtual patient cohorts to ascertain the variability we might expect in trial results under close to real-world conditions. The resultant predicted survival curve is an ensemble estimate with variability for not only the control group but also the predicted “potential” benefit informed directly by the preclinical data. This pipeline will help us narrow down strategies for future trials, optimize timing of treatments relative to key standard-of-care treatments, and predict synergy amongst the developed treatments.\n",

        "# Introduction {#sec-introduction}\n",
        "\n",
        "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most commonly diagnosed primary malignant brain cancer in adults. Current standard of care consists of maximal safe surgical resection followed by concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy (with temozolomide) [@stupp2005]. Despite this aggressive treatment, outcomes remain poor with median survival of only 15 months [@ostrom2019]. The aggressiveness and fatal outcomes of GBM can be attributed to its highly inflitrative nature and to the vast intra- and inter-patient heterogeneity. Malignant cells can be found infiltrating far into the peritumoural areas of the brain and are undetectable by conventional imaging and operative techniques. Furthermore, tumours contain an array of different cell types with distinct molecular and phenotypic characeristics, hindering therapy efficacy. In particular previous studies have identified a sub-population of malignant glioma cells with stem-like characteristics known as glioma stem cells (GSCs) or brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) that are highly resistant to both radio- and chemo-therapy and therefore contribute to treatment failure. Thus, if treatment outcomes are to be improved for patients with GBM, it is vital that therapeutics that specifically target these GSCs are developed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The existence of a population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) was first established in leukemia [@lapidot1994; @bonnet1997]. More recently CSCs have been identified in many solid tumors including breast, colon and brain [@al-hajj2003; @ricci-vitiani2007; @ignatova2002; @hemmati2003; @singh2004; @galli2004]. In GBM, cells expressing the CD133 cell surface protein marker (also found on neural stem cells) have been identified as GSCs based on their exclusive ability to commence and support tumour growth [@singh2004]. In addition to being tumor initiating, GSCs are highly resistant to both radio- and chemo-therapy as they are more efficient at inducing repair of damaged DNA than the bulk of the tumour cells [@bao2006; @tang2021; @rich2007; @stiles2008; @schonberg2014; @turner2009; @dirks2006]. Furthermore, they also engage in a synergistic relationship with the surrounding tumour microenvironment (TME) to promote angiogenesis, proliferation, migration, tumour survival, and immune evasion [@ma2018]. Under the brain cancer stem cell hypothesis, it is becoming increasingly clear that while radiation may be transiently effective, treatment ultimately fails in the long run if any GSCs survive [@dingli2006].\n",
        "\n",
        "If, as with normal tissues, cellular phenotypic heterogeneity within tumours can be explained by a hierarchy of differentiation, with only a subset of stem-like cells capable of long-term self-renewal [@carén2016], this raises the prospect that signals promoting differentiation could be effective at driving malignant cells to a less aggressive and ideally post-mitotic differentiated state. This differentiation therapy approach has seen success in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) where all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) can promote differentiation of CSCs and lead to complete remission [@dethé2018; @yan2016]. In GBM, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), a member of the TGF-$\\beta$ superfamily, has shown potential as a differentiation therapeutic agent. BMP4 has been shown to drive differentiation of GSCs towards a predominantly glial (astrocytic) fate, to reduce GBM tumor burden *in vivo* and to improve survival in a mouse model of GBM [@nayak2020; @carén2016; @piccirillo2006]. The precise mechanism through which BMP4 acts is unknown but a possible explanation is that it reduces the frequency of symmetric divisions of GSCs [@guerrero-cázares2014], and previous mathematical models of differentiation therapy have assumed that differentiation promoters act in this way [@youssefpour2012; @bachman2013].\n",
        "\n",
        "Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) provide a possible alternative to tradition treatment, as these cells migrate toward areas of malignancy, and can be utilized to home towards the infiltrating glioma cells [@li2014; @mangraviti2016; @pendleton2013; @smith2015; @doucette2011]. A migration assay showed that compared to controls, engineered AMSCs significantly retained their tropism and preferential migration towards GBM factors. Additionally AMSCs can be engineered to secrete BMP4 for GBM therapy [@mangraviti2016; @kim2020; @guerrero-cázares2014; @tzeng2011]. It has been shown that nanoparticle-engineered AMSCs maintain their multi-potency characteristics and release their therapeutic cargo progressively, furthermore systemically-delivered engineered AMSCs can cross the blood-brain barrier and retain their preferential tropism towards gliomas [@mangraviti2016]. Therefore, AMSCs delivery promises the ability to hone in on CSC niches and locally release treatment to these regions. AMSCs can act as a local treatment delivery through application to the surgical resection bed following a craniotomy. In this case, BMP4-loaded AMSCS (BMP4-AMSCs) would theoretically migrate to CSCs, release BMP4, and increase the rate of their differentiation, reducing the number of GSCs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Clinical trials typically consist of four phases in which a new intervention is investigated in human subjects to determine its safety and efficacy. This system is notoriously resource intensive and inefficient. The average cost per patient is \\$59,500 and takes more than 10 years with only 10% of drugs in phase 1 studies eventually approved [@dowden2019; @yankeelov2024]. In GBM, the statistics are even worse, with multiple recent phase 3 trials have failed to meet their prespecified primary endpoints [@bagley2022; @reardon2020; @cloughesy2020; @weller2017; @narita2019; @roth2021]. Of course, there are many reasons for these failures including inter- and intra-patient variability, drug delivery limitations, paucity of control arms, overly stringent clinical eligibility, and beyond [@bagley2022]. Increasingly it is being realised that mathematical modelling and *in silico* clinical trials can assist in addressing a number of these problems.\n",

We can use this linear relationship to estimate $\\alpha$ on a patient specific level as $\\alpha = 0.05m_v$ [@rockne2010]. To account for the fact that GSCs are less sensitive to radiation than other cancer cells we include the additional parameter $\\eta$ that represents this radio-protection. Previous experiments have estimated this protection factor to be $\\eta = 0.1376$, suggesting GSCs are roughly six times less sensitive to RT than other cancer cells [@gao2013; @bao2006].

        "Since GSCs are less sensative to RT than other cells the fraction of GSCs increase due to RT, this is captured in our model in Figure @fig-example_sims. In particular RT is more effective against faster proliferating tumors [@rockne2010] so this effect is particulalry pronounced in these tumors. This enrichment of GSCs due to RT not only shows that there are some resistent cells that are not being targeted by RT but also these are the most tumorigenic cells, with a large proportion of GSCs a recurrent tumour is able to form very rapidly (as compared to not at all if no GSCs were present). When we simulated the addition of BMP4 we see that this peak in stem-cell fraction is reduced due to the indcued differentation. This means that not only is the RT more effective as there are fewer resistant GSCs but also that the tumor will take longer to recurr as there are fewer GSCs to drive the growth. As the increase in GSC fraction is most pronouced in faster proliferating tumors we see that the relative effect of BMP4 in delaying proression is also largest for these patients.\n",

        "In practice a phase 2 trial will have only a small number of patients (typically around 20-40) and the population will be heterogenous with respect to efficacy/response to BMP4. We can use our virtual trial pipeline to consider the chance of observing a successful trial for different virtual populations. For our virtual phase 2 trial we generate 20 virtual patients, with parameters drawn from @tbl-params and $\\psi$ from a truncated normal distribution with a series of different mean values. We simulate virtual controls for these patients, undergoing resection and RT as well as our proposed new therapy of resection, BMP4 and RT.\n",

We construct these by sampling twice as many virtual patients (proliferation rates) as we need for each trial (40) and then splitting them into either the top 50% fastest proliferators, the middle 50%, and the slowest 50%, we also consider a non-stratified case where we just sample 20 proliferation rates from the distribution. This assumes knowledge of growth rates for patients enrolled in the trial, which is straightforward for our simulated virtual patients. For each such stratification we perform 20 virtual trials this gives us an idea of the chance of observing a successful trial.\n",

As $\\psi$ increases the fraction of successful trials increases, as expected. If we consider the faster proliferating cohort we see the same trend but the effect of BMP4 is more pronounced so we observe more successful trials even when BMP4 responsiveness is not as strong. If we consider the slowest proliferators we observe that almost no trials are successful, even when BMP4 sensitivity is high. Finally if we consider the case when we don't stratifify by proliferation we see we are unlikely to observe a suscceful trial as there is too much variation in response in the cohort.

Through our simulations, we are able to better understand which patient-specific parameters are important for treatment efficacy and simulated survival times. For example, the parameter $\\psi$ is very important, this represents the intrinsic sensitivity of patients to BMP4. Our group has identified some potential biomarkers such as Olig2 and pRB. To design successful clinical trials, understanding these biomarkers will be vital for selecting patients and assessing efficacy of the treatment.\n",

We showed that as the mean populaton level sensativity to BMP4 increases the chance of observing a successful trial increase However patient stratification is also vital for observing successful trials. As we show even with a large senstavivty to BMP4 if a cohort of patients are picked which have a below average proliferation rate there is almost no chance of observing a successful trial. While faster proliferating tumours have a greater relative benefit from BMP4 so are much more likey to be successful. \n",
